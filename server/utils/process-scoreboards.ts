Follow these instructions precisely:\n\n1.  **Identify Data Points:** Extract the following information from the image:\n    * The exact date and time of the match.\n    * The names of the two participating teams. Their names are found immediately after the "[Victory]" or "[Defeat]" tag associated with "[Guild Defender]" or "[Guild Unit]". For example, if you see "[Guild Defender][Victory] TeamAlpha", then "TeamAlpha" is the victory team name. Similarly, "[Guild Unit][Defeat] TeamBeta" means "TeamBeta" is the defeat team name.\n    * For **each** participant on the **victory team**: name, Kill/Death ratio (kd), debuffs applied (or relevant status effect count/metric), damage dealt, damage taken, and healing done.\n    * For **each** participant on the **defeat team**: name, Kill/Death ratio (kd), debuffs applied (or relevant status effect count/metric), damage dealt, damage taken, and healing done.\n * Deaths are found within the "K/D" value. The number of **deaths** is the integer value **after** the forward slash ("/") ex: 15/9 the deaths are 9  \n   * Kills are found within the "K/D" value. The number of **kills** is the integer value **before** the forward slash ("/"). For example, in "21/9", the kills are 21. Ensure you convert this value to a whole number (integer) before any calculations. The "/" is the only separator between kills and deaths.\n    * The total number of kills achieved by **each team**. Sum the individual kills (the number before the "/") for all participants on each team. Ensure this summation is accurate.\n\n2.  **Perform Calculations:**\n    * ** Calculate victory_team_score as an array of integer kill counts for each victory team participant;\ncalculate defeat_team_score as an array of integer kill counts for each defeat team participant.\n   3.  **Format Output:** Structure the extracted and calculated data into a single JSON object matching this **exact** format. `victory_team` and `defeat_team` must be arrays of participant objects.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      "date_hour": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM",\n      "victory_team": [\n        {\n          "name": "participant_name",\n          "kd": "Kills value",\n      "deaths":"Deaths value",\n            "debuffs": "value",\n          "dealt": "value",\n          "taken": "value",\n          "healed": "value"\n        }\n      ],\n      "defeat_team": [\n        {\n          "name": "participant_name",\n          "kd": "Kills value",\n      "deaths":"Deaths value",\n          "debuffs": "value",\n          "dealt": "value",\n          "taken": "value",\n          "healed": "value"\n        }\n      ],\n      "score": {\n        "victory_team_score": [kill_int_1, kill_int_2, ...]\n  "defeat_team_score": [kill_int_1, kill_int_2, ...]},\n      "victory_team_name": "winning_team_name",\n      "defeat_team_name": "losing_team_name"\n    }\n    ```\n\n4.  **Output Constraints:**\n    * Your response MUST be **only** the JSON object defined above.\n    * Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, apologies, summaries, or markdown formatting like ```json` or ```.\n    * Ensure the `date_hour` value strictly follows the `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format. Extract the single relevant date and time from the image.\n\n5.  **Error Handling:**\n    * If the image does not contain clearly identifiable information for **all** required fields (both teams, participants with stats, date/time, team names, data needed for score calculation), or if the content obviously isn\'t a game result screen matching this structure, then your **entire response** must be **only** the following JSON object:\n        ```json\n        {"error": "Image data does not match the required structure or is insufficient."}\n        ```\n    * Do not attempt to generate partial JSON or guess missing values.
